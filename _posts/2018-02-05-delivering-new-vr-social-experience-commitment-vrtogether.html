<h1>Delivering your new VR social experience: our commitment in VRTogether</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Although VR has been a buzz word for the past few years, VR experience delivery is still at its infancy. There are some products starting to use <a href="http://gpac.io/2016/05/25/srd/">tiles</a> and other techniques to broadcast VR videos but real deployments still stream flat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">equirectangular</a> videos. There are no standards able to stream and merge 3D models (e.g. "3D videos" or persons) in a unified social VR experience. <a href="http://vrtogether.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRTogether</a> comes to the rescue.</p>
<p><strong>VR Together</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://vrtogether.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VRTogether</a> is a consortium about social virtual reality. Our goal is to provide a social virtual reality experience that mixes up natural and artificial (e.g. a movie and 3D-reconstructed persons). In one of the <a href="http://vrtogether.eu/about-vr-together/pilots/">content samples</a> developed, users are able to reenact themselves an experience which looks like one they could have seen in a thriller.</p>
<p><strong>Market status</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>while problems are getting solved, news is given way less coverage.</p></blockquote>
<p>The world of VR has acted strange lately. After the sudden boom (from 2014's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality">Oculus Rift acquisition by Facebook for $2bn</a> to 2017's reality check from the market), new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-mounted_display">HMDs</a> have been presented at the CES 2018, solving real issues (increased field-of-view, better displays, less motion-sickness, autonomous). However while problems are getting solved, news is given way less coverage.</p>
<p>Social VR has been teased a lot during this VR frenzy. Who doesn't remember this Facebook/Oculus conference with a room full of people wearing a Rift?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mark-zuckerberg-samsung-unpacked-2016.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2333" src="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mark-zuckerberg-samsung-unpacked-2016-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond the awe that provoked this image on many people, there is an undeniable fact: social VR is one of the futures of VR.</p>
<p><strong>Social VR</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Social VR is one of the futures of VR.</p></blockquote>
<p>To get a full experience of social VR, you need your friends to be represented in full 3D with a feeling of interaction with them. There are some technical catches:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of now, there are <strong>no standards</strong> to stream 3D videos. The two main technologies that compete are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh">Meshes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud">Point Clouds</a>. Both approaches are at different stages of standardization. Without a specification handled by a serious body (MPEG, W3C, etc.), device and browser integrations are absent. These are a key points as of 2018 and we are working on it.</li>
<li><strong>Bandwidth limitation</strong>. 3D representation of the users need to be sent in real time, which requires a lot bandwidth at the moment to get a smooth experience. We are talking of 50mbps for a realistic representation.</li>
<li><strong>Latency</strong>. We have to ensure that, to be able to interact convincingly with your friends, you'll be able to see yourself moving instantly, and your friends without any perceptible delay. A self-representation should show almost zero-delay.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong>: the users should not perceive strange artifacts (e.g. lip sync, freezes, zombies, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>The dust is settling down, the VR mania is down, and now, we can really start to get really serious about it.</p>
<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.motionspell.com">Motion Spell</a>, the company under <a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/">GPAC Licensing</a>, will support that objective at<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/meetings/122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> NAB 2018</a>, and at <a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/meetings/122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPEG 122 in San Diego.</a></p>
<p>The technical objectives of the consortium is to provide more reliable technological bricks to support packaging and delivery of such experiences. As such, <a href="http://www.motionspell.com">Motion Spell</a> will deliver a first prototype as part of the VRTogether Pilot one, which will be available this semester.</p>
