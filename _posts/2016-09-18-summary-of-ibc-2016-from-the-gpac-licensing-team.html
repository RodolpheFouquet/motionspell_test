<h1>Summary of IBC 2016 from the GPAC Licensing team</h1>
<p>Dear followers,</p>
<p>We are back from IBC and we wanted to share with you our thoughts and feelings about IBC 2016.</p>
<p>Each and every year there are more demos powered by <a href="http://gpac.io">GPAC</a>, and more of the technology we standardize that is included in innovative demos. This included fine synchronization between devices, hybrid delivery, <a href="http://gpac.io/2016/05/25/srd/">360/VR videos delivered using tiles</a>.</p>
<p>IBC was a continuation of IBC 2015 (<a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/2015/09/18/summary-of-ibc15-from-the-gpac-licensing-team/">our report for 2015</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>IBC is less crowdy every year although organizers claim <a href="http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/techfacils/ibc-2016-in-numbers/5109439.article">55,796</a> unique attendees this year, up from 55,128 in 2015.</li>
<li>There are more startups (and <a href="http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/techfacils/ibc-2016-in-numbers/5109439.article">249 new exhibitors</a>).</li>
<li>OTT platforms are more mature and migrate to live.</li>
<li>The HEVC ecosystem still suffers from patent issues.</li>
<li>Open-source software is more widely deployed.</li>
<li>People moved from pure 4K to more evolved ecosystem including HDF, HFR, color ranges, sound.</li>
</ul>
<p>But <b>the hot subject this year was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">Virtual Reality (VR)</a></b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>VR is still years away from being a mass market. All projections target 2020 for a reasonable market size. VR estimation is around $13bn-$50bn revenue in 2020.</br>Edit: <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-predicts-vr-will-be-bigger-than-tv-in-10-years-2016-1?r=DE&IR=T">$110bn according to Goldman Sachs</a></li>
<li>VR will target dozens or hundreds of millions of users "only" (when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented Reality</a> will target virtually every smartphone). VR sends you in a new environment and likely won't interact with reality until it gets more mature. In the long term (2030?) VR and AR will probably merge.</li>
<li>The VR industry is driven by entertainment. But <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602353/vrs-big-surprise-3-d-worlds-have-little-appeal/">3D worlds still have little appeal</a> and that's the 360 video side that still drives the expansion of VR.</li>
<li>VR arrives through mobile. Look at the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/Gear_VR">Samsung Gear VR</a> for example. Cheap initiatives like <a href="https://vr.google.com/">vr.google.com</a> makes experiments really easy.</li>
<li>Business models are multiple: hardware, sales, advertising... but the pioneer market is gaming, followed by the Broadcast and Movie industries. VR applies to many domains: virtual tours, security, trainings, car parking, etc. There is no clear dominance.</li>
<li>As of 2015 most money is raised to build Headsets. The software solutions are ready with affordable <a href="http://www.video-stitch.com/">realtime stitching</a> and <a href="https://www.orah.co/">integrated cameras</a>.</li>
<li>VR will not look like anything we know. It will look like the stories of our real lives.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">VR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">AR</a> are two different subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of tech leaders like <a href"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-prefers-augmented-reality/story?id=42064913">Tim Cook</a> thinks AR is more interesting than VR. In the long term AR will be available in any mobile device with no extension.</li>
<li>AR relies on real videos (sometimes 360 videos) so the capture part is easier. However integrating an element on an existing content is more difficult than building a new content with all the elements in it. This makes AR a significantly longer term milestone.</li>
</ul>
