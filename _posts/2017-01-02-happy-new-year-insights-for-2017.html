<p>Dear readers,</p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
<p>2016 was a very good year businesswise for GPAC. In our sense we will just keep on improving <a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/2016/01/05/2016-predictions-based-on-gpac-licensing-business-trends/">things we started in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>But 2016 was a sad year for our industry: standards failed to gather because of patents issues for both MPEG HEVC and MPEG DASH. And MPEG CMAF, while being a good step for convergence, won't be the standard that will unite <a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/2014/12/01/hls_introduction/">Apple HLS</a> and MPEG DASH. The industry also failed to build some efficient solutions to deploy UHD.</p>
<p>These uncertainty allowed to accelerate some transitions: SDI to IP (2022-6), improvements on AVC encoding, <a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/2016/09/18/summary-of-ibc-2016-from-the-gpac-licensing-team/">first deployments of VR and AR</a>. 2017 could also be the year of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2017-year-video-goes-people-glenn-leibowitz">democratization of video</a>.</p>
<p>For our wishes, we will just quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Brel">Jacques Brel</a> in 1968:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wish for you dreams which never end,<br />
and the furious desire to achieve some of them.</p>
<p>I wish for you to love what must be loved<br />
and forget what must be forgotten.</p>
<p>I wish you passions.</p>
<p>I wish you silences.<br />
I wish for you birdsongs upon awakening<br />
and the laughters of children.</p>
<p>I wish for you to resist the downtroddeness,<br />
the indifference,<br />
the negative virtues of our times.</p>
<p>Above all I wish for you to be you.â€‹</p></blockquote>
