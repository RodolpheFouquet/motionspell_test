<p>There are both business and&nbsp;legal considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Business</strong></p>
<p>GPAC comes from the industry. Open-source projects sometimes&nbsp;try to get legitimaty by getting into the industry field but GPAC Licensing finally connects us to our roots! &nbsp;You can read more about the project history in <a title="About us" href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/about-us/">the About Us page</a>.</p>
<p>According to SourceForge, our open-source host, the GPAC pages have been&nbsp;hit over 3 300 000 times&nbsp;during the last year. That's the result of a long-run innovation leadership.</p>
<p>GPAC has already been used by the biggest and most successful companies in the entertainment field, video sharing websites, movie studios, consumer electronics, broadcast encoders, embedded systems, etc.</p>
<p>We have a worldwide recognized experience on the broadcast and rich-media technologies. You'll find our names on many standards, academic papers, W3C mailing-lists, awards.</p>
<p><strong>Legal</strong></p>
<p>GPAC is licensed under the LGPL license of the Free Software Foundation. The GPL-like licenses are known to be business unfriendly. Contrary to permissive BSD/MIT licenses, it asserts you must provide your product users with the same fundamental freedoms you were given: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#Definition">run, study, copy, improve</a>.</p>
<p>If you plan to give GPAC a try and use it internally, you can keep using GPAC without telling anybody. However we encourage you to <a title="Contribute" href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/contact/">share your work with us</a>!</p>
<p>The LGPL (the first 'L' standing for "Less") is said to be compatible with a business use as long as you use the LGPL program into a separate module (e.g. dynamic library). It indeed allows a wider distribution and that's why many programs, including GPAC, VLC, or FFMpeg/Libav, have chosen this license.&nbsp;However the LGPL license has some subtleties:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must publicly say you use GPAC every time you distribute your product.</li>
<li>You cannot forbid reverse-engineering on your EULA.</li>
<li>Here is a more complete&nbsp;<a href="http://libav.org/legal.html">compliance list</a>&nbsp;of the accepted rules in the open-source community. Laws may be different depending on your jurisdiction. This list does not oblige you but we advise you to consult a copyright lawyer if you wish not to follow it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
