<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Getting the best team is your number one problem. You want to recruit the best: the "A" players (i.e. the best ones, opposed to &ldquo;B&rdquo; players (good ones) and &ldquo;C&rdquo; players (average or below average workers)).</p>
<p>The book provides a method in 4 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li> A scorecard for recruiting.</li>
<li> A way to source your recruitments.</li>
<li> A selection process made of structured interviews.</li>
<li> A way to sell yourself in an attractive way. Because in the end you want the best candidates to chose you.</li>
</ol>
<h3>General advice</h3>
<p>Don't hire generalists, hire specialists.</p>
<p>Recruiters identified two ways to recruit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skills: you need that skill or you have a specific project.</li>
<li>Talent: you bet on a person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Candidates often consider being recruited as an investment or a transaction.</p>
<p>Consider making a small game to get candidates engaged during the process.</p>
<h3>About "A" players</h3>
<p>The A players critical competencies:</p>

<li> Commitment.</li>
<li> Coachable.</li>
<li> Ego under control.</li>
<li> Requisite intellect.</li>
</ul>
<p>A player also have cultural competencies. You may hear them say things like "Service the customer a lot better than competitors" and do anything they can to achieve it.</p>
<h3>Step 1: the scorecard</h3>
<p>How to create a scorecard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission: statement of 5 sentences to describe the role.</li>
<li>Outcomes: 3 to 8 metrics.</li>
<li>Competencies (5 to 8) "competencies include efficiency, honesty, high standards, and a customer service mentality".</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure alignment with scorecard and communicate on it</li>
<p>Keep using scorecards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set expectations with new hires.</li>
<li>Monitor employee progress over time.</li>
<li>Objectify your annual review system.</li>
<li>Allow you to rate your team annually.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: sourcing</h3>
<p>The book provides very generalist advice in this section.</p>
<h3>Step 3: structuring interviews</h3>
<p>To get more details, use the "What ?", "How ?", and "Tell me more ?" questions.</p>
<p>You want to conduct 4 interviews. Each interview should take 45 minutes to 1 hour. See in the next sections.</p>
<h4>Master tactics</h4>
<p>Four points to make interviews more productive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interrupt gently to spare anyone's time: I would love to hear about...</li>
<li>Three P to evaluate performances: Previous, Plan, Peers.</li>
<li>Push/Pull: A players are pulled out of their positions while B/C players are pushed out by their employers.</li>
<li>Paint the full picture and stop at show-stopper.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Interview 1: screening</h4>
<ol>
<li>What are your career goals?</li>
<li>What are you really good at professionally? Insist to find 5 to 8 items.</li>
<li>What are you not good at or not interested in doing?</li>
<li>Who were your last five bosses, and how will they each rate your performance on a 1-10 scale when we talk to them? Ask them why they would be rated such a score. Consider 7 to be neutral.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Interview 2: who</h4>
<p>Screen the personality:</p>
<ol>
<li>What were you hired to do?</li>
<li>What accomplishments are you most proud of? A Players tend to focus on outcomes when B and C players talk about events and people.</li>
<li>What were some low points during that job?</li>
<li>Who were the people you worked with? Be specific to activate the "threat of the reference check".
<ul>
<li>What was your boss name and how do you spell that? What was it like working with him/her? what will he/she tell me were your biggest strengths and areas for improvements?</li>
<li>How would you rate the team you inherited on an A, B, C scale? What changes did you make? How would you rate the team on an A, B, C scale?</li>
</ul>
<li>Why did you leave that job?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Interview 3: focus</h4>
<p>The purpose of this interview is to talk about a specific subject.</p>
<ol>
<li>What are your biggest accomplishments in this area during your career?</li>
<li>What are your insights into your biggest mistakes and lessons learned in this area?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Interview 4: references</h4>
<p>Don't skip the references. And don't limit to the candidate's list.</p>
<p>Questions to ask to the reference:</p>
<ol>
<li>In what context did you work with the person?</li>
<li>What were the person's biggest strengths?</li>
<li>What were the person's biggest areas for improvement back then? Take notes because these usually don't change.</li>
<li>How would your rate his/her overall performance on a scale from 1 to 10?</li>
<li>The person mentioned that she struggled with [subject] in that job. Can you tell me more?</li>
</ol>
<p>Double check the cultural fit.</p>
<h3>Step 4: sell yourself in an attractive way</h3>
<p>We all know it is important to find the thing that matters most. What would make her/him dream about the job.</p>
<p>The authors define the 5 &lsquo;F&rsquo;s to attract the candidate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fit,</li>
<li>take care of their Family,</li>
<li>Freedom (not micromanaged),</li>
<li>Fortune,</li>
<li>Fun.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The cost of recruiting</h3>
<p>Cost of an agency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upfront.</li>
<li>Success fee: 18% to 25% of the gross salary (when you pay less there will be less work behind so you may received unqualified candidates).</li>
</ul>
<p>Recruiting has a cost in time.</p>
