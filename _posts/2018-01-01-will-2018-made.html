<h1>What will 2018 be made of?</h1>
<p>We wish you the best for 2018!</p>
<p>2017 was definitely a year of transition. Since we give trainings and license code (including R&D code) we see the trends. 2018 will be a year of consolidation.</p>
<p>In early 2017, the VR market collapsed after a reality check. So did HDR and 4K. This is just a phase until the technology finds its market. On the contrary AI, metadata and customized ads became a reality. The transition to IP and cloud also reached another step although I wouldn't bet on it in the short term for the broadcast industry. See also our <a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/2017/09/21/summary-ibc-2017/">IBC report</a>.</p>
<p>GPAC Licensing still follows the strategic path we described 2 years ago. Here are our main targets for 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server-side toolkit to build your own workflow: <a href="http://signals.gpac-licensing.com">Signals</a>. Existing solutions were way too expensive and complex. Low-latency, RTSP to DASH, HEIG to JPEG, transmuxing, dynamic metadata insertion, ... everything becomes possible!</li>
<li>Mobile and cloud end-to-end offers: we may bundle an offer under the GPAC Licensing name but most of our technology is available in <a href="https://firekast.io">Firekast</a>.</li>
<li>Conformance: there is room for better analyzers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
