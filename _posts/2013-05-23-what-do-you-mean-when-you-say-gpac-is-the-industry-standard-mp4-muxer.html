<p>There exists many MP4 demuxers but only a few MP4 muxers. And most of them are not interoperable.</p>
<p><a title="What is a standard and what does it cover? (featuring a MPEG-DASH case study)" href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/2013/10/14/standard-cover-mpeg-dash-case-study/">The MP4 standard is architectured around a core specification called Iso Base Media File Format (ISOBMF, MPEG4 part 12) and several interoperability standards (such as MPEG4 part 15 for H264/AVC integration) and then recommandations</a>. It is a full-time job to keep updated.</p>
<p>GPAC goes even further as it serves as a reference implementation and experimentation platform in the standardization field. We feature <a title="MP4Box" href="http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/mp4box/">MP4Box, our packaging tool</a>, and a full playback infrastructure.</p>
