<h1>The Convergence TV Project Demonstrates World First SHVC Based HD/UHD Hybrid Delivery at NAB 2018</h1>
<p>PRESS RELEASE &ndash; Rennes, Paris (France), April 4<sup>th</sup>, 2018</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/downloads/nab2018/PRESS RELEASE Convergence TV Project @ NAB Futures Park_final.pdf">PDF version</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><em>From 9 to 12 April 2018 / At the Las Vegas Convention Center / North Hall - NAB Futures Park - Booth <strong>N1531FP</strong></em></p>
<p>At NAB 2018, the <strong>Convergence TV project</strong> demonstrates the delivery of a full UHDTV service using an ATSC 3.0 broadcast path for distributing a regular HD service (2K + HDR) and an ATSC 3.0 broadband path for <strong>enhancing the service from HD to UHDTV (4K + HDR).</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the use of scalable HEVC (<strong>SHVC</strong>) for audio &amp; video compression, <strong>no</strong> <strong>simulcasting will be needed.</strong> The broadcast path delivers the HD signal while the broadband path delivers only the enhancement signal from HD to UHD.</p>
<p>Both paths are fed from a <strong>single SHVC encoder</strong> providing the base layer signal to the broadcast chain and the enhancement layer to the broadband chain.</p>
<p>Two receivers show the service enhancement. There are a <strong>regular ATSC 3.0 TV</strong> <strong>set</strong> displaying the basic HD HDR service and &nbsp;a <strong>PC based hybrid receiver</strong> prototype able to combine the base and enhancement layers thanks to a SHVC decoder.</p>
<p>The regular ATSC 3.0 TV set will show the <strong>backward compatibility</strong> of the approach, as a regular HEVC enabled TV set can decode the SHVC base layer without requiring specific upgrade.</p>
<p>This <strong>world first</strong> demo intends to showcase one of the exclusive features of the ATSC 3.0 system approach - the native <strong>hybrid delivery</strong> mechanism - which ensures quasi-unlimited flexibility for enhancing the user experience.</p>
<p>It illustrates a business case where regular broadcast HD service delivery (2K) can be enriched to UHD (4K) - and monetized - through an optional broadband connection.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung</strong> supports the project by providing the ATSC 3.0 TV set for the backward compatibility demonstration. Being fully UHD and SHVC compliant, this TV set is <strong>another world first</strong> through its ability to display UHD services when both the base layer and enhancement layer are distributed through the broadcast path.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>About the Convergence TV Project</strong></p>
<p>Convergence TV is a research project powered by five French innovative and high tech companies: <strong>TeamCast</strong> (lead), <strong>ATEME, Broadpeak, Motion Spell (GPAC Licensing), TDF</strong> and two prestigious academic research institutes: <strong>INSA Rennes</strong> and <strong>Telecom Paristech</strong>.</p>
<p>The main objective of the project is to work on hybrid delivery of advanced TV services, using a broadcast delivery as mainstream and broadband add-ons for a better Quality of Experience, immersivity or interactivity. The project has chosen ATSC 3.0 as the all IP hybrid delivery system.</p>
<p>The Convergence TV project is sponsored by the French government and two local councils (Region <strong>Bretagne </strong>and Region<strong> Ile-De-France</strong>).</p>
