<h1>Meet the GPAC Team @ MPEG</h1>
<p>GPAC people are attending the MPEG 106th meeting in San Jose, California, USA.</p>
<p>These meetings are important moments of the GPAC life. They allow to discuss the opportunities of new <a title="What is a standard and what does it cover? (featuring a MPEG-DASH case study)" href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/2013/10/14/standard-cover-mpeg-dash-case-study/">multimedia standards</a> and build them.</p>
<p>The GPAC team has submitted many contributions on draft specifications over the last 10 years. It has also shown many demonstrations including <a href="http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/2011/01/24/gpac-95th-mpeg-meeting/">our MPEG-DASH implementation</a>&nbsp;or our <a href="http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/2013/04/26/mpeg-hevc-support-in-gpac/">HEVC recommendations</a>&nbsp;in April 2013.&nbsp;And of course our usual activities such as MPEG2-TS, ISOBMF/MP4, and <a href="http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/2011/03/22/meet-the-gpac-team-mpeg/">others</a> depending on time and meetings.</p>
<p>This presence of open-source contributors to research and standardization meetings is very important for innovative projects. It gives us the opportunity to influence the future (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a> said: "The best way to predict the future is to invent it"). It helped us build a solid reputation of experts and builders.</p>
<p>Please&nbsp;<a title="Contact" href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/contact/">leave us a message</a>&nbsp;if you wish to meet.</p>
