<p>Click <a href="https://www.gpac-licensing.com/2019/09/18/ibc-2019-report-the-calm-before-the-storm/">here</a> for our report about the IBC content.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This year IBC was in our opinion the best edition of the last five years. After a disappointing NAB 2019, and a very disappointing IBC 2018, IBC 2019 made conservative choices to concentrate on what is essential.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First we are still waiting for IBC's official number but let's not elude: <strong>there were less people (visitors and exhibitors) than last year</strong>. This is a trend that has started in 2014. We are not sure this is avoidable as trade shows of our industry have turned from a meeting for enthusiasts with companies bringing their whole teams to a giant social event. However starting on Saturday and until Tuesday <strong>we report buses on students coming on our booth. This is unacceptable</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Fortunately this year IBC was more focused on the professional video industry</strong>. Fancy startups and service companies that we could see at NAB this year (or at IBC the previous years) were apparently discouraged to participate.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another benefit of unpacking and filtering companies is that we could feel <strong>more space and more relevant locations for companies</strong>. While looking for potential partners this proved as a huge game-saver. The press area was also gathered in one unique place and there was no fancy massage or haircut booths.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is the first year that we find useful information in the "IBC Daily". <strong>The mobile application and the IBC365 program also helped to make IBC a more connected event</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Although IBC saturates Amsterdam in term of accommodations, the RAI, where IBC is located, is now very well connected by all kind of transportations. <strong>Since last year you can eat decently without leaving the RAI</strong> thanks to the numerous foodtrucks installed in the courtyard in the center of the RAI.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>The Future Zone showed its real potential.</strong> A lesser density of booths with more space allowed projects to present themselves more effectively. The IABM Future Trends Theater was open to anybody with an <a href="https://www.theiabm.org/ibc-future-trends-theatre/">interesting program</a> and proved to be full each time I came by.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yet IBC could benefit from a few improvements. In the short term <strong>the conferencing part could be more selective</strong>. While there were prestigious organizations around the table we didn't feel the outcome of the presentations and round tables was up to the stake. Also <strong>IBC has no reason to stay free for visitors</strong> (each year during the week-end the show is filled with wanderers which is clearly not cool for exhibitors).</p>
