<p>Our professional users have much to bring to the project: experience, vision, code, money, ideas... This project is a way for everyone of us to build better projects.</p>
<p>GPAC is conducted by professionals in their respective fields. We think the open-source offer may be not enough when you want to build a product based on GPAC.</p>
