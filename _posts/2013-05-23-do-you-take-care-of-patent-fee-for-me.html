<p>No, it doesn't. It is our customers' responsability to define the intellectual property&nbsp;fees which apply to their products. These&nbsp;fees&nbsp;must be negotiated separately with the holding organizations (such as MPEG-LA).</p>
<p>GPAC is modular and allows you to deactivate some parts of the code. It ensures that you won't have to pay fees for features you don't use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
