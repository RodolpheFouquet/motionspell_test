<p>Whilst we cannot know the exact list of GPAC users or are not allowed to give their names, you can find big companies like YouTube, Sony, ... many small companies and startups all around the world, and some of the most used open-source multimedia projects such as x264.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been reported traces of GPAC all over the world, including mainstream devices and applications, featuring: set-top boxes, phones, radio receivers, video games consoles&hellip;</p>
